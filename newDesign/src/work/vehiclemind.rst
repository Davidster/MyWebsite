Vehicle Mind
============

I worked at `Vehicle Mind <https://vehiclemind.com/features>`_ in 2018 and 2019. They
are a company which sells an OBD-II device that plugs into supported vehicles and 
offers related features and insights. Once a user plugs the device in, among other
features, they can view their fuel, battery, mileage as well as get human-readable
descriptions about their engine diagnostic codes when the check engine light is visible.

Since Vehicle Mind was a very small company at the time, working there was a great
way for me to learn some of the crucial interpersonal skills needed to work in
a fast paced environment and to effectively interpret business requirements. Also,
due to the scope and complexity of the problems we were solving, I was required
to greatly sharpen my technical skills.

Device Data Sandbox
-------------------

One of the tools I created at Vehicle Mind that was particularly memorable was a
small web interface that could be used to view data from the test devices that we
were using while developing the product. There wasn't much complexity to the tool.
It essentially let the user input the ID of the device, choose the device properties 
of interest, specify a date range, then view the results in a simple line graph
visualization.

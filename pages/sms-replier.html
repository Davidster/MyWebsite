        <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.davidhuculak.smsreplierplus&hl=en" target="_blank">Sms replier</a> is an android app which I made as a science fair project in high school with the goal of learning mobile app development.

        The application was designed to allow the user to set up an automatic response system for when they missed phone calls. When turned on, it would listen for any missed calls and in the event that one would occur it responds by sending a pre-determined text message to the caller. It is useful for situations when you know you won't have access to your phone for a certain period of time and therefore would not be able to respond.

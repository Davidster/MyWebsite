	<h2>Description</h2>
	<p>
	Myostro is a project that I built at a <a href="https://mhacks6.devpost.com/" target="_blank">MHacks 6</a> with a team of three other students from McGill University. Our goal was to use the <a href="https://www.myo.com/" target="_blank">Myo Armband</a> to empower DJs, allowing them to use gestures with their arm & hand in order to orchestrate a musical spectacle.
	</p>
	<p>
	The application allowed for the selection of tracks through pointing one's arm in the direction of the desired track. Once a track was selected, the DJ could perform a fist gesture to toggle it between playing and not playing. The volume of each track could also be controlled by rotating one's hand in either direction.

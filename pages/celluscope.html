    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Celluscope is a tool that I built at <a href="https://hackmit.org/" target="_blank">HackMIT</a> with a team of three others who I had met the same morning that we started working on it. The aim of the project was to make use of a special lens which screws onto the front of an iphone, allowing its camera to be greatly magnified. What we wanted to achieve was to be able to take a photo of a blood sample with a cell phone and perform some processing on the image, determining whether the sample was infected with malaria or was of an individual with sickle cell anemia, or was simply healthy blood.
    </p>
    <p>
        In order to accomplish this, we used a software service named <a href="https://clarifai.com/" target="_blank">Clarifai</a> which uses machine learning under the hood. This service allowed us to train an image recognition model by providing it with a set of photos via a javascript API which were labelled as positive or negative for our two concepts: "has malaria" &amp; "has sickle cell anemia". In the end, the model was able to provide a higher percentage score for photos containing the disorder than ones which did not.

        We made a very simple iphone application which made use of our tool, allowing the user to select a photo and then displaying the resulting percentage score for whether malaria or sickle cell anemia is present.
